This is very inconvenient for central London. \nIf you take your family to a show then you need to be able to get food on your return to the hotel as it\u2019s not practical to use restaurants late at night in central London when you have young kids.

It was perfect. They gave him a card along with some chocolates and a bottle of Prosecco. The rooms are modern and the beds are very comfortable! The balconies were a nice touch. One down point was the cleanliness slightly lacked when we found crumbs under a cabinet\u2026 BUT that is the only minor fault and is completely disregarded with the standard of the hotel overall! Thank you so much guys","date":"18 Sept 2021","author":"Rachel"},{"rating":"4\/5 Good","reviewText":"The first point I would like to make is that we never got the room we booked on Hotels.com, and they didn't tell us until we were checking in, my wife and I always book a terrace room where we can as we like our evenings on the terrace and telling us so late left us a little cornered. They did however give us free parking and breakfast, but this room we got in place was not what was expected.\n\nSaying that, the staff here are amazing, they could not do enough for us, they are friendly and helpful, they were always happy and willing to help.\n\nPros - Room was spotless and large, dinning was excellent and everything was cooked well, hotel itself is very airy and easy to get around, rooms are quiet and the bed was brilliant. Good pillows and the coffee tray was excellent with lots of choice.\n\nCons - The hotel itself was very hot, the room AC was weak and did nothing and in our room the extractor in the toilet didn't work and the balcony door didn't lock, also the balcony is standing room only, parking was underground and was a very low ceiling.","date":"13 Sept 2021","author":"ANDREW"},{"rating":"5\/5 Excellent","reviewText":"Very good hotel in a residential location near primrose hill, very comfy bed & lovely room, impressed with the hotel overall","date":"13 Sept 2021","author":"Janet"},{"rating":"5\/5 Excellent","reviewText":"Super hotel in a quiet part of London not far from the beautiful Regents Park.

Good room size and clean. Would have liked a quieter room, our room was next to one of the Marriotts operation rooms, (sounded like a laundry\/ machinery room) could hear it slighlty from our side of the room but not a major problem. Did have some late guests talking loudly in the middle of the night, (assuming from a jolly night out) obviously out of the control of the hotel. Apart from that I would stay again.","date":"30 Aug 2021","author":"Gurveer"},{"rating":"5\/5 Excellent","reviewText":"Superb location, indoor swimming pool and friendly and professional service","date":"30 Aug 2021","author":"Yuen Ling"},{"rating":"5\/5 Excellent","reviewText":"Just enjoyed a lovely stay at the Marriott Regents Park. Family of 3 staying in a huge and modern room which was clean and stylish.\nCheck in was easy and the hotel is spotless throughout and very modern internally. Good proximity to the tube too.\nWe also made use of the pool which was lovely and warm and the leisure club member of staff was very friendly and polite explaining where everything was. Towels were also provided which is great. The pool is a decent size and nicely warm.\nWe also added breakfast to our booking and this also didn't disappoint. A friendly face showed us to our table and explained the system which is essentially a help yourself buffet. The choices were plentiful with a large choice ranging from cereals, fruit, drinks and a full hot food cooked breakfast selection. All the food tasted fresh and we were properly stuffed as we headed off.\nOur sleep was lovely and quiet and the beds were massive.\nAlso nice to enjoy a really hot and powerful shower in the morning and the quality of the complimentary shower gels and moisturisers were a nice addition.\nIf you're looking for a quality hotel with added facilities and a nice quiet stay, I'd gladly recommend this one.\nMaybe not the cheapest hotel but you pay for what you get and the clientele who frequent the hotel were also of a high standard which I personally feel makes the experience far more enjoyable.","date":"30 Aug 2021","author":"Judit"},{"rating":"3\/5 Okay","reviewText":"","date":"29 Aug 2021","author":"Roslyn"},{"rating":"5\/5 Excellent","reviewText":"Stayed 3 nights in a family room with my wife and son. 5 min walk from Swiss cottage tube, near leisure centre so easy to find. Nice reception area and bar with a Carluccios restaurant as well. Gym and swimming pool available for guest use. Underground car park but expensive, \u00a333\/night. The room was spacious and lovely, comfy twin beds and clean with all amenities. Bathroom clean and modern with toiletries, separate shower cubicle was good. Service was good and requests were prompt. The pool was great and we used it a few times. Lovely warm water and great for the young ones. You have to book a slot which we did but we stayed longer if not busy. Carluccios was ok but food was a little bland and service a little slow. We ate out in Camden which is a 15 min walk, loads of options and Camden lock market had an amazing array of food stalls. We tried as many as we could! There is also Swiss cottage high street which had many shops. We found a lovely cafe for breakfast called the Garden Cafe and a lovely Korean restaurant called Zaangs, delicious food. the hotel itself is nice, location is great, tube is near and Camden market within walking distance. Also Regent's park and Primrose hill is close if you need some green space. A great stay in a lovely hotel.

I was very pleasantly surprised. I wasn\u2019t too happy about paying \u00a333 per day for parking and the car park was small and really tight to squeeze your car in.

When we returned in the evening there was a function in the hotel, not too much of a problem, we all expect functions at big hotels like this, although our room was directly above the function room. On the Sunday morning, we were promptly woken with a live band in the same function room. It was extremely loud - louder than I can possibly explain! I rung down to reception and was told there was a regular religious meeting taking place. This is not something we were told when booking the room! The room we were allocated was directly above the function room and to be perfectly honest, Sunday morning ruined our trip. If we had been told previously that this even would be held, we would have asked to have been moved. As we were awake anyway we started to make ourselves a cup of tea to find there was not enough teabags, sugar or milk! What a disappointment!

It looks that it used to be an apartment and redeveloped as a hotel. The interior of the room is modern and stylish. Cleanness is meeting the expected standard\r\n\r\nLocation : Better than expected. 15 mins walk to Primrose hill which can command good view to the city centre. 7 mins walk to Swiss Cottage tube station which takes you to Soho in ab 20 mins.\r\n\r\nBreakfast : Not value for money. (16 GBP per person). Food looks nice but tasted really bad. Scrambled egg was dry and sausage is really hard. French bread smells mixture of old olive oil and egg. Omelet was dry. Croissant was not fresh. Watermelon and orange tasted funny...(The melon and grape fruit was not bad). The coffee tasted like instant coffee and many more. I would recommend you to try some brunch cafe in Soho rather than wasting your money on hotel breakfast buffet.\r\n\r\nSwimming pool : The pool itself is small but good for use. Hotel was quite busy with people but couldn't find many in hotel swimming pool. The locker\/shower room\/ changing room is very convenient to use. (They provide complimentary towel)\r\n\r\nParking - Affordable if considering it's London - 31 GBP per day. But since they allowed you to park during your stay, it could be more than just 24 hour.

The Jubilee tube line is very convenient for going to many tourist attractions without needing to change lines.\n\nIt's in a great quiet residential neighborhood.  There is a great recreational facility next door.","date":"18 Aug 2018","author":"Maodad, Ottawa, Canada"},{"rating":"5\/5 Excellent","reviewText":"","date":"16 Aug 2018","author":"Verified traveller"},{"rating":"3\/5 Okay","reviewText":"","date":"16 Aug 2018","author":"Terry"},{"rating":"5\/5 Excellent","reviewText":"","date":"16 Aug 2018","author":"Verified traveller"},{"rating":"5\/5 Excellent","reviewText":"The hotel was very central to all the London attractions.

Sometimes used towels were left behind and used glasses were not replaced just turned over. \r\n    Overall, it was a good stay but not enough to make me say I'd come back.
